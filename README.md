# Mini-Project
A simple C++ program to track personal income and expenses. Users can add transactions with notes, display all entries, and remove transactions. All data is saved in a CSV file (finance.csv) for persistence. Built using object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling.
